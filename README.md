# ML_Python_Stock_Market_Prediction

## In this project I tried to create Machine Learning Model that predicts the next day price movement of Stock Market.  
  
  
### I have taken historical data of American Stock Exchange Index S&P500.The data is imported from Yahoo Finance API. I will also backtest this model to gain some confidence in prediction this model is making.  S&P500 is the stock market index tracking the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on Stock Exchanges in USA. It is one of the most followed equity indices having more than $ 5 trillion invested in assets tied to performance of this index.

Following steps have been followed  

(1) Importing Data from Yahoo Finance  
(2) Cleaning and Visualizing Data  
(3) Training an initial machine learning model  
(4) Building a backtesting system--Backtesting model over a periods of 10 years to predict next years stock prices and checking the precision score  
(5) Adding additional predictors to improve accuracy  
(6) Imporving model accuracy by Hyper Parameter Tuning  
(7) Listing scope of further work on this project
